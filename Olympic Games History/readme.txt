Introduction

The ‘modern Olympics’ comprises all the Games from Athens 1986 to Rio 2016. The Olympics is more than just a quadrennial multi-sport world championship. 
It is a lense through which to understand global history, including shifting geopolitical power dynamics, women’s empowerment, and the evolving values of society.

In this kernel, my goal is to shed light on major patterns in Olympic history. How many athletes, sports, and nations are there? Where do most athletes come from? Who wins medals? What are the characteristic of the athletes (e.g., gender and physical size)?

I also zoom in on some particuarly interesting aspects of Olympic history that you might not know about.
